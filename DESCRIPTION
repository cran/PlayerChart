Description: Create an interactive pizza chart visualizing a specific player's statistics across various attributes in a sports dataset. The chart is constructed based on input parameters: 'data', a dataframe containing player data for any sports; 'player_stats_col', a vector specifying the names of the columns from the dataframe that will be used to create slices in the pizza chart, with statistics ranging between 0 and 100; 'name_col', specifying the name of the column in the dataframe that contains the player names; and 'player_name', representing the specific player whose statistics will be visualized in the chart, serving as the chart title.
